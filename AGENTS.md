# 🤖 ANTIGRAVITY AGENT INSTRUCTIONS & CORE PRINCIPLES

## 🚨 MANDATORY CHECK BEFORE ANY ACTION (NGUYÊN TẮC TRONG NGUYÊN TẮC)
Before modifying ANY file or executing any logic, you MUST adhere to the following:
1. **IMMUTABILITY OF STANDARD FORMULAS & PARAMETERS:**
   - The EDM physics formulas, standard pass tables (P1 to P6), standard speeds, and manufacturer baselines are **STRICTLY IMMUTABLE**.
   - NEVER alter these core equations or standard baselines unless explicitly commanded by the user.
2. **ISOLATED WORKSHOP CALIBRATION ZONE:**
   - Any workshop-specific calibration (matching actual factory cut times, ammeter readings, or specific workpiece offsets) must ONLY be adjusted inside the designated **Workshop Calibration Model / Table**.
3. **BACKUP CONVENTION:**
   - Place all zipped backups in `/backups/autocut_YYYY-MM-DD(n).zip`.
4. **VERSION INTEGRITY:**
   - Keep versions synchronized across `app.js`, `index.html`, `style.css`, `version.json`, `sw.js`.
5. **CONTINUOUS EMPIRICAL CALIBRATION (VÒNG LẶP HỌC MÁY THỰC NGHIỆM):**
   - The user will routinely provide actual cutting results (e.g., actual dimensions, cutting time, surface finish) from their workshop.
   - The agent MUST actively use these empirical data points to recalibrate the offset, speed, and other outputs in the Workshop Calibration Model (Tab 2) to ensure the software converges on perfect accuracy for the user's specific machine conditions.
